Matching is done! Time to go shopping for some local snacks!

Please ship your box by

<%= @exchange.end_date.strftime("%B %d, %Y") %>

Make sure you read your snackees details to see if there are any food
allergies.

You can be reimbursed up to $25 USD worth of snacks and the shipping
costs from Concur.

Since SnackBox is all about bringing us together, write a little note to
brighten their day and let them know who you are and where you are from!
